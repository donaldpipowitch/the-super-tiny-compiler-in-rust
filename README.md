***Welcome to The Super Tiny Compiler!***

_ported to Rust_

This is a port of the excellent [the-super-tiny-compiler](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler) written by @thejameskyle from JavaScript to Rust.

It is mainly an exercise for myself, but probably useful for others as well.

If you want to understand the high level algorithm you should read the original JavaScript code which has very useful comments.

_Note_: The current version doesn't work. I just published it to ask some questions about asserting enums in Rust more easily.
